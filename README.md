## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide information to potential investors in a bike sharing business venture in Des Moines, Iowa based on data provided for New York City. To analyze this data, I used Python to convert some data into datetime and then created visualizations using Tableau Public. 

## Results
The following visualizations provide more detail in bikeshare usage and customers to market to:

image 1
Customers in NYC primarily use bikes for 60 minutes or less, with a peak of 5 minutes.

image 2
Peak traveling hours during the month of August for NYC were rush hour traffic times - 5:00-7:00 pm and 8:00 am.

image 3
Further evidence of peak ridership occuring during morning and evening rush hours during the week, and increased usage during lunch hours on Saturdays. 

image 4
More than 3/4 of bike share users are subscribers to the program. 

image 5
By a large margin, most bike share users are male. 

image 6
Male riders show particularly heavy usage during weekdays, especially on Thursdays and Fridays. 

image 7
In a breakdown of usage by starttime and gender, it's clear that both males and females use bike share during morning and evenings (likely traveling to and from work), with more males overall. 

## Summary
Overall, males tend to use bike shares much more than females, likely traveling to and from work during the weekdays. Bike share users are a good source of stable income as they tend to be subscribers. To provide even more in depth analysis, I would create two additional visualizations:
1. a pie chart showing subscribers by gender and
2. trip length in miles to determine where bike 'hubs' should be located.
